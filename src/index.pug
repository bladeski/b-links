      p This is my blog and a compilation of links that I find useful - a sort of library/reference. It is very much a work in progress!
      p I've built this with the following principles in mind...

        h3 Accessibility 
        p 
          | I've tried to keep accessibility at the forefront of this project. I feel that all too often it is something that
          | is bolted onto the end of a project, and rarely done particularly well, so by keeping it as a primary focus when
          | developing, I'm hoping to change my own approach and mindset to how accessible a site is.
      section
        h3 Performance 
        p 
          | Whilst high speed networks and devices are common-place these days, I wanted this site to be performant on both devices 
          | that don't have the power that many of us take for granted, and for those times that our network is patchy.
      section 
        h3 Simplicity 
        p 
          | As much as I appreciate bells and whistles, I feel that sometimes keeping something simple is, well, just, plain nicer!
          | But keeping things simple - whether it's what the user sees or what's going on behind a site - isn't always a simple task,
          | and often means stripping down and revising code. 
      section 
        h3 Progressive Enhancement 
        p 
          | This ties in nicely to the other principles in that I wanted to keep this site clean, simple, performant and accessible,
          | whilst also providing a richer experience where possible. Progressive Enhancement is my way of doing this.
      section 
        h3 Summary 
        p 
          | So this is the standard I'm trying to keep to. As I already said, it is very much a work in progress, and will continually 
          | evolve, but I hope to remain faithful to these principles.
