The obvious downside of this is that the size of the CSS has increased considerably, from 6KB to a whopping 19KB! That being said, there is a lot of scope for optimising this - I just need to get around to it - maybe in 6 months time when I decide to look at it again!\n\n","categories":[""],"_id":"1683898784646665","createdAt":"2023-05-12T13:39:44.646Z","updatedAt":"2023-05-12T13:56:01.753Z","name":"My-b-links-Journey-part-2","markup":"<h2 id=\"being-too-clever-for-my-own-good\">Being too clever for my own good!</h2>\n<p>So after having not updated b-links for a while (I have a tendency to go 'gung-ho' at things and then get distracted by other projects...)
