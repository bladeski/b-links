<p>B-links started very much as a concept for a highly accessible, performant site, which would serve as a library of useful links - for myself as much as anyone - and a blog... a small outlet for my thoughts.</p>
<p>It has been an interesting journey so far, building both a minimalist front-end and an API simultaneously, as well as a management portal to let me easily add blog posts and links, but I've really enjoyed it, from the first sketches that I scribbled on a piece of my son's drawing paper, to getting a semi-working page deploying out to GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>I guess a lot of it has been pulling together a number of my various skill-sets, from UI and UX design, to front-end development and also configuring of build pipelines and deployments. But there has been a lot I've learned along the way - designing and deploying a MongoDB database, and using Azure functions to serve as an API have been just a couple of areas that I've never touched on previously.</p>
<p>After scribbling that first design, which was mostly some high level doodles with some annotations and more questions than answers, I've slowly built up a picture of what 'this' should be, and started to work on it, iterating as I go. I've recently heard Mike McQuaid from GitHub talk about his <a href="https://mikemcquaid.com/the-best-project/">best project ever</a> and one of the big takeaways from that was to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'...fail faster and improve faster.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has been one of the most important parts of developing b-links... trying to iterate regularly, constantly reviewing what I've done to see what works and what doesn't, and I think has been one of the great successes of the whole project.</p>
