But there has been a lot I've learned along the way - designing and deploying a MongoDB database, and using Azure functions to serve as an API have been just a couple of areas that I've never touched on previously.</p>\n<p>After scribbling that first design, which was mostly some high level doodles with some annotations and more questions than answers, I've slowly built up a picture of what 'this' should be, and started to work on it, iterating as I go. I've recently heard Mike McQuaid from GitHub talk about his <a href=\"https://mikemcquaid.com/the-best-project/\">best project ever</a> and one of the big takeaways from that was to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>'...fail faster and improve faster.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This has been one of the most important parts of developing b-links... trying to iterate regularly, constantly reviewing what I've done to see what works and what doesn't, and I think has been one of the great successes of the whole project.</p>\n","categories":["Test"],"_id":"1683190056975393","createdAt":"2023-05-04T08:47:36.975Z","updatedAt":"2023-05-04T08:47:36.975Z"}]}}
